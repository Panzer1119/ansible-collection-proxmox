  0.3.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - pve_set_up_ansible_user - Fixed an issue where the variable ``ansible_user``
          was used, despite it being a reserved Ansible variable. This has been replaced
          with ``proxmox_user`` to avoid conflicts.

    release_date: '2025-09-28'
  0.3.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - pve_set_up_ansible_user - Fixed an indentation error in the sudoers configuration
          task that prevented the looping.
    fragments:
      - 0.3.2.yml
    release_date: '2025-09-28'
  0.3.3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - pve_set_up_ansible_user - Switch to mapping the list of allowed lxc ids
          to commands instead of looping over it. Because the loop executes the task
          multiple times, it would overwrite the sudoers file multiple times, resulting
          in only the last entry being present.
